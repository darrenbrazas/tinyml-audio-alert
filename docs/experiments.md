# Experiements & Observations (Version 2)

- Increased accuracy prediction an alarm sound
- better at differentiating between alarm and noise
- re-recorded samples for noise
- increased sample quantity

# Experiements & Observations (Version 1)

- Initial models showed sensitivity to background noise
- The ambience of background noise tricked the model to believe that it was the pause between alarm sounds
- Confidence threshold tuning improved stability
- Model performance varies with enviroment
